# Security Policy

## What this repository is

`quote-rescue` is a local-first quote-to-decision-pack compiler that states 'I don't know' where its source was silent.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Preferred: GitHub private vulnerability reporting.** Open the **Security** tab on this repository and
choose **Report a vulnerability**. That channel is private between you and the maintainer, requires no
email, and nothing is posted publicly. Private reporting is enabled on this repository.

If you cannot use that channel, open a **minimal public issue** stating only that you have a security
report and how to reach you. Please do **not** include exploit details, proof-of-concept code, or
affected-version specifics in a public issue.

## Scope

**In scope:** Any place the tool **invents** a value its source did not contain; any silent substitution of a default for missing data; and any output that presents an inferred figure as a sourced one.

**Out of scope / stated plainly:** Outputs are derived from the documents you supply. This tool does not verify that those documents are accurate or complete.

## What to expect

| Stage | Commitment |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement of your report | within 7 days |
| Initial assessment and severity call | within 14 days |
| Fix, or an agreed public disclosure | coordinated with you |

You will be credited in the fix or advisory unless you ask to remain anonymous.

## What this policy does NOT offer

There is **no bug bounty**, and no monetary reward is offered or implied. This is an independent
research project maintained by one person. What it can offer is a fast, honest response and public
credit.
